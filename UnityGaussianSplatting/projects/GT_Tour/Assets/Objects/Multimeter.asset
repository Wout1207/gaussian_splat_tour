  description: "Ah! You seek knowledge, yes? Then behold... the sacred Multimeter!
    \n\nThis trusty sidekick is your go-to for measuring voltage, current, and resistance
    basically, the Swiss Army knife of electronics. Need to check if a battery's
    alive or if a resistor\u2019s lying about its value? The multimeter\u2019s got
    your back. It won\u2019t judge your circuit-building skills\u2026 but it will
    beep at you if you mess up the connections. Just set the right mode, plug in
    the probes, and pretend you know exactly what you're doing works every time. "
