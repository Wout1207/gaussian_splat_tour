  description: "Welcome, traveler... You stand before the mighty Power Supply of
    Eternal Voltage \n\nWith the power to deliver stable, adjustable voltage and
    current, this relic fuels your circuits with precision. Whether you need 3.3V
    for your microcontroller or 12V to awaken the beast a.k.a. your motor, it answers
    your call. But tread carefully too much current, and even the bravest resistor
    may fall in battle. \n \nUse the knobs wisely, and may your outputs forever remain...
    regulated. "
