  description: "A mysterious warmth radiates nearby... It\u2019s the legendary Soldering
    Iron! \n\n \nWielded by makers and tinkerers alike, this tool lets you melt metal
    and permanently unite components on a PCB. Apply heat, feed solder, and behold
    a shiny connection that carries current and hope (mostly current). It\u2019s
    ideal for repairs, prototypes, or impressing people who\u2019ve never touched
    a breadboard. \n\n \nJust keep your fingers clear of the tip unless you enjoy
    learning through pain. "
