  description: "A wild Oscilloscope appears! \n \nDon\u2019t worry it\u2019s friendly,
    and it\u2019s here to help you see what your circuits are up to. This tool displays
    voltage over time, letting you observe waveforms, measure frequency, and spot
    weird glitches faster than your professor catching late submissions. Connect
    the probe to a signal, and boom you\u2019re reading real-time electrical behavior
    like a voltage detective.  \n\nJust remember: every knob has a purpose\u2026
    probably. Twist responsibly. "
