  description: "Greetings, young engineer! You have unlocked... the Function Generator
    of Many Waves! \n\nThis arcane device conjures sine, square, triangle, and more
    signals to test the very soul of your circuits. Need a clock source? A test signal?
    A chance to nod confidently when someone mentions signal integrity? It\u2019s
    got you covered. Just dial in the frequency, amplitude, and waveform, then launch
    your signal into the great unknown. \n \nRemember: if it looks like a clean sine
    wave and no smoke comes out, you're probably doing it right. "
