  description: "A confident figure steps forward... It\u2019s Ga\xEBl, the Lab Whisperer!
    \n \nRumored to have debugged a circuit with a single glance, Ga\xEBl guides
    students through tangled wires and tangled thoughts alike. Need help with the
    oscilloscope? Accidentally let out the magic smoke? Ga\xEBl appears calm, prepared,
    slightly judging. Armed with knowledge, coffee, and the patience of a saint,
    they turn chaos into clarity (and sometimes working prototypes). \n \nApproach
    with questions, offerings of snacks, or genuine confusion; Ga\xEBl shall respond...
    if you're worthy. "
